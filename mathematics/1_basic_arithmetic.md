# Maths: Basic Arithmetic

## Number Sets

## Odd numbers

Odd numbers are the numbers that contains the digit 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 in the ones
place. A fact about odd numbers is that dividing an odd number by 2 gives a
remainder of 1.

$ \mathbb{O} = \{1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, \ldots\} $

Examples:

* 1 is an odd number.
* 153 is an odd number.
* 1001 is an odd number.
* 21 is an odd number.

## Even numbers

Odd numbers are the numbers that contains the digit 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 in the ones
place. A fact about even numbers is that dividing an even number by 2 gives a
remainder of 0.

$ \mathbb{E} = \{0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, \ldots\} $

Examples:

* 0 is an even number.
* 42 is an even number.
* 100 is an even number.
* 152 is an even number.

### Natural Numbers

Natural numbers also known as counting numbers are the numbers used for counting
elements in a set. The set of natural numbers is denoted by $ \mathbb{N} $.

$ \mathbb{N} = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, \ldots\} $

### Whole Numbers

Whole numbers are the numbers used for counting elements in a set including zero.

$ \mathbb{W} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, \ldots\} $

### Negative Numbers

Negative numbers are values less than zero. Negative numbers are denoted by a
"-" sign before the number.

$ \mathbb{N} = \{-1, -2, -3, -4, -5, \ldots\} $
$ \mathbb{N} < 0 $

### Positive Numbers

As opposed to negative numbers, positive numbers are values greater than zero.
They usually do not have a sign before the number but can be denoted by a "+".

$ \mathbb{N} = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, \ldots\} $
$ \mathbb{N} > 0 $

### Integers

An integer are positive and negative whole numbers including zero that do not
contain a fractional part. Integers are denoted by $ \mathbb{Z} $.

$ \mathbb{Z} = \{\ldots, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots\} $

### Rational Numbers

A rational number is a number that can be expressed as a fraction of two
integers. Rational numbers are denoted by $ \mathbb{Q} $.

$ \mathbb{Q} = \{\frac{p}{q} | p, q \in \mathbb{Z}, q \neq 0\} $

Examples:

* $ \frac{1}{2} $ is a rational number.
* $ \frac{3}{4} $ is a rational number.
* $ \frac{5}{6} $ is a rational number.

Rational numbers can be expressed as decimals that either terminate or repeat.
To those decimals that terminates are called "terminating decimals" and those
repeating in a pattern are called "repeating decimals".

Examples:

* $ \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 $ is a terminating decimal.
* $ \frac{1}{3} = 0.333\ldots $ is a repeating decimal.
* $ \frac{1}{6} = 0.1666\ldots $ is a repeating decimal.

> To decimal number be rational, it must be either terminating or repeating and
> must be able to be expressed as a fraction of two integers.

If a is repeating decimal eg. $ 0.333\ldots $, then it can be expressed as
$ 0.\overline{3} $ where the bar over the 3 indicates that the 3 repeats forever.

### Irrational Numbers

An irrational number is a number that cannot be expressed as a fraction of two
integers. Irrational numbers are denoted by $ \mathbb{I} $.

$ \mathbb{I} = \{x | x \notin \mathbb{Q}\} $

Examples:

$ \pi = 3.14159265358979323846264338327950288419716939937510582097\ldots $

> The number $ \pi $ is most famous irrational number.

$ \sqrt{3} = 1.732050807568877293527446341505872366942805253810380628055\ldots $

### Real Numbers

The set of real numbers is the set of all rational and irrational numbers. Real
numbers are denoted by $ \mathbb{R} $.

$ \mathbb{R} = \mathbb{Q} \cup \mathbb{I} $
